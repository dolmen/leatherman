# Leatherman - fREW's favorite multitool

This is a little project simply to make trivial tools in Go effortless for my
personal usage.  These tools are almost surely of low utility to most people,
but may be instructive nonetheless.

Currently code quality is of low importance, and getting the tools ported from
Perl and Python is higher priority.  Anything that uses non-core modules is a
higher priority.  Anything that needs concurency is also of higher priority.

The intended flow for this is that tools will be functions that get added to the
`dispatch` table in `main`.  Eventually I will factor things into separate
packages, but not yet.  I will set up some kind of CI to build this into a
single binary and add a `symlink` tool that builds symlinks for each tool in the
busybox style.

I will add automation to my dotfiles to pull the latest binary at install time
and run the `symlink` tool.

## Current tools

### `addrspec-to-tabs`

Converts email addresses from the standard format (`"Hello Friend" <foo@bar>`)
to the mutt (?) address book format, ie tab separated fields.

Note that this new version ignores the comment because, after actually auditing
my addressbook, most comments are incorrectly recognized by all tools. (for
example: `<5555555555@vzw.com> (555) 555-5555` should not have a comment of
`(555)`.)

### `clocks`

My personal, digital, wall of clocks.
